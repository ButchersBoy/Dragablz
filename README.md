![Alt text](http://dragablz.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/dragablzwindowsnap.gif "Demo shot")

- Docs 'n' help 'n' stuff: [dragablz.net](http://dragablz.net/)
- NuGet details here: http://www.nuget.org/packages/Dragablz/
- You can criticise the developer here: [@James_Willock](http://twitter.com/James_Willock)
  - No, seriously, please get involved and give me a ping with any questions/requests.
- **If you like it, or where it's going, please *star* it!!!**  A bit of love goes a long way ;)

## A note on the demo project:

- You will have to restore NuGet packages
- I've seen Visual Studio get confused with both the .net 4.0 and 4.5 projects.  If you see this compile Dragablz.net4*, and then DragablzDemo.net4* by right clicking on the project in the solution explorer.  I'll try and improve this at some point...

## Features:

- Drag and tear tabs
- User friendly docking
- Floating tool windows
- Supports MVVM
- IE style transparent Windows
- Chrome style trapzoid tabs
- Custom (and optional) Window which supports transparency, resizing, snapping, full Window content.
- Miminal XAML required, but hooks provided for advanced control from client code
- Single light weight assembly targeting .net 4.* frameworks, no additional dependencies

## In the pipeline:

- Layout persistance and restore
- Extra themes
